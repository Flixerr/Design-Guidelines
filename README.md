# Flixerr Design Guidelines

Flixerr is intended to be very minimalist in nature. This entails the use of white-space, bold text contrasted by lighter fonts, simple navigation, and smooth transitions. Color should only be used when necessary, such as indicating an active state or primary action.

## Colors

Mainly grayscale, but when necessary use the primary color below.

#### Primary
**HEX** 4361EE

**RGB** 67, 97, 238

**NAME** Ultramarine blue

## Fonts

**HEADING** Proxima Nova

**PARAGRAPH** Roboto

## Icons

We use [Feather icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) as our main icon library, but if it doesn't provide what you're looking for, feel free to use a similar library.
